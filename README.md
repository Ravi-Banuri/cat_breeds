# About the Project

The project is implemented to demonstrate
* SOLID principles and design pattern for Presentation layer(eg- MVVM-MVI),
* Clean Code Architecture,
* Modularisation,
* DI Hilt setup,
* Jetpack Compose,
* Coroutines, and
* Unit tests

## Architecture

[MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Clean architecture]
pattern has been used in the development of this application. The development language of the
application is Kotlin. Clean Architecture is a design approach that separates concerns, promoting
maintainability and testability. Combining MVVM with Clean Architecture helps organize an Android
app into layers like

* Presentation Layer
* Domain Layer
* Data Layer

## Tech Stack
In this project use below technologies
Kotlin
 Corooutimes
 State flow

Jetpack
  ViewModel
  LiveData
  Compose UI

DI Hilt
Retrofit

Unit Test
 Mockk

# Features

- In this project list of cat breeds fetched from "https://catfact.ninja/" and shown in list form in first screen
- when a list item is clicked details of selected cat breed are shown in second screen

## Unit Testing

MockK is used for unit testing the API and network-related components. It allows you to create
mock objects and simulate the behavior of external dependencies to ensure that your API interactions
are tested independently.
